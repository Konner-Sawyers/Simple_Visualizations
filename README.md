# Simple Visualizations
### Basic visualizations made in Python using Pyglet
<br>

### Overview
<p>The goal of this collection of projects is to create simple visual programs that can be create in a couple of hours or less.<br>
Content here can be easily reused in future projects as a sort of blueprint or atleast as a starting idea for larger goals.</p>
<br>

### Programs

#### Conway's Game of Life
<p>Yet another adaptation with John Conway's Game of Life that allows for adjustments to grid columns and rows as well as the chance of a cell starting in an alive state allowing for more active or inactive simulations.</p>

#### 1D Perlin Noise
<p>A basic perlin noise implementation that determines the 'height' of the given terrain. The simulation can be a low resolution or high resolution with high resolution which basically determines the number of columns. You may also adjust the sample height frequency which determines how often noise is used with a higher frequency value lowering the amount of variance due to less samples being taken.</p>

#### Simple Vector Field
<p>A simple example vector field simulation wherein the mouse acts as an anonymous particle or force. The point of this project was to display the ability to create a vector field that could then be adjusted with a force in the future for a targeted simulation.</p>

#### Simple Singular Pendulum
<p>Basic singular pendulum that just shows the given period based on input length and acceleration due to gravity. Will more than likely be built into a double pendulum to allow for more complex simulations.</p>
